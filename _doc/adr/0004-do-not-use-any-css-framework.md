# 4. Do not use any CSS framework

Date: 2021-07-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Because:

- the app is simple,
- the styles are pre-defined and available at figma,
- the company probably already has a design system in place which would have the custom style readily available.

We decide it is not necessary to use any CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Tailwind.

## Decision

We will use vanilla CSS (plus SASS, due to baked-in Rails support) to style our pages.

## Consequences

N/A.
